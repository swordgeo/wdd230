      <h1>Resources & Attributions</h1>
      <p>Like many new programming students (or as I'm beginning to understand, programmers in general), this website being built as well as it did would have had major, time-consuming road blocks were it not for an incessant amount of Googling and dozens of amazing people that came before me to ask and answer the questions I had myself.</p>
      <p>As much as I endeavored to work on this project 100% "on my own" without any outside influences, <a href="https://abn.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1999/10/no-man-is-an-island?lang=eng&adobe_mc_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.churchofjesuschrist.org%2Fstudy%2Fgeneral-conference%2F1999%2F10%2Fno-man-is-an-island%3Flang%3Deng&adobe_mc_sdid=SDID%3D0938DB8EA79AC5DC-0B135BFCFCEC4454%7CMCORGID%3D66C5485451E56AAE0A490D45%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1649297889">"no man is an island"</a> unto himself, and I am no exception. I have faithfully worked on this project alone, without no help nor influence from anyone in my life, nor any of my classmates. That said, as I mentioned earlier, a lot of Google searches were necessary to get me where I am, and while I (eventually) remembered to try to keep track of them, sadly some contributions accidentally go uncredited.</p>

      <p>The weather data on my home page was provided by <a href="https://openweathermap.org">Open Weather Map</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp">W3Schools</a> helped me figure out the buttons on my home page slides</p>
      <p>On the Temples page, I had a <strong>bad</strong> problem where my "Learn More" buttons' onclick were automatically firing. I wasted too much time fighting it until <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5743863/onclick-gets-fired-without-clicking">this thread</a> on Stack Overflow reminded me I needed to wrap it in a function.</p>
      <p>I used the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/list?lang=eng">church's temple database</a> to find my json data. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Temples_(LDS_Church)_in_the_United_States">Wikipedia</a> told me a lot of each temple's history.</p>
