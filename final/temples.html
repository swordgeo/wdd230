<!--
📄 The Temple page describes the details for at least four temples of your choice providing information about the address, telephone, email, services, history, ordinance schedule, session schedule, temple closure schedule. This information must be stored in a separate JSON file in order to be considered for full credit. You can store this .json file in another 📁folder in your site folder. Display the temple information like a layout of 'cards'. You may elect to have additional information shown upon clicking a card. Provide a 'LIKE' button/interface that the user  can click to 'like' a particular temple and that information is stored in localStorage. The next time a particular user visits, that 'like' indicator should be apparent.
Temple Information can be found on Temples list (Links to an external site.) on lds.org.
